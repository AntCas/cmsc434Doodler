Doodle App Prototype
====================

This Android app was built for CMSC434 at UMD


How To Install & Run

You should be able to build the app without making any changes.


Features
========

Change color, size, and opacity:

You can change the color, size, and opacity of your pen using the three buttons at the bottom of the screen.
Click the button which corresponds to the attribute you wish to change and you'll see a dialog appear.
The dialog contains a slider which you can use to adjust the attribute.

Clear screen:

Click the "CLEAR SCREEN" button at the top right of the app to clear your canvas.

Activitate Mirror Mode:

Toggle the mirror button at the top left of the app to turn on and off mirror mode. 
Mirror mode reflects your doodle in all four corneres of the app, allowing you to create interesting symmetrical patters.

Did not end up using any code from Stack Overflow in the final version, but it was useful for troubleshooting bugs.
